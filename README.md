DCGAN is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using CNN.

-- The discriminator learns to discriminate real from fake images.
-- The generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating fake images.
-- The generator + discriminator form an adversarial network.
-- DCGAN trains the discriminator and adversarial networks alternately.
-- During training, not only the discriminator learns to distinguish real from fake images, it also coaches the generator part of the Adversarial network on how to improve its ability to generate fake images.
